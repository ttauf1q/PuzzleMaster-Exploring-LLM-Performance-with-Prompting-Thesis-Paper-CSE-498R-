# Thesis Overview
PuzzleMaster is an undergraduate thesis project aimed at exploring and comparing the problem-solving capabilities of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) through carefully designed prompts. The system evaluates how well different LLMs perform on a wide range of logical, mathematical, and word-based puzzles, helping determine their strengths and limitations in complex reasoning tasks.

# Research Objective
The central aim of this thesis is to:

- Investigate the problem-solving efficiency of state-of-the-art LLMs.

- Measure performance through structured prompting on both rule-based and rule-less puzzles.

- Develop a comparative framework based on metrics like accuracy, creativity, response time, and error rate.

# Models Evaluated
Five different LLMs were tested in this study:

- Gemini

- Cohere

- LLaMA 2.7

- LLaMA 3

- LLaMA 3.2 Instruct

Each model was assessed under uniform prompt structures to ensure a fair evaluation.

# Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy

- Completion Time

- Response Time

- Creativity

- Response Quality

- Error Rate

# Future Scope
Plans for future improvement include:

- Integrating Computer Vision to solve visual puzzles.

- Expanding the dataset for broader puzzle variety.

- Enhancing the system’s multi-modal capabilities.
